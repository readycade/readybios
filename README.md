## INSTALLATION

### Windows 10/11 Supported ONLY:
Select a Bios Pack from your computer and let EZ_BPacks_Installer.exe do the rest!

(Must be a supported Bios Pack either .zip or .7z with Recalbox in the title)


The newer python based GUI app is more user friendly.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## OLD BATCH SCRIPT

Essentially what the script does is offer you a drag and drop solution to install Bios files to Recalbox.

## INSTALLATION

### Windows 10/11 Supported ONLY:
Just Download the EZ_Bioz.zip, Extract it.. Drag and Drop your Bios.7z/Bios.zip ontop of drag-and-drop.exe and let go.

It puts everything in ALL THE RIGHT PLACES!
```
eg: /recalbox/share/bios/
```
